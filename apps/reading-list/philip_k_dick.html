      Philip Kindred Dick was an American novelist, short story writer, and essayist whose
      published work during his lifetime was almost entirely in the science fiction genre.
      Dick explored sociological, political and metaphysical themes in novels dominated by
      monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, and altered states. In his
      later works, Dick's thematic focus strongly reflected his personal interest in
      metaphysics and theology. He often drew upon his own life experiences and addressed
      the nature of drug abuse, paranoia and schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences
      in novels such as A Scanner Darkly and VALIS.
