    Philip Kindred Dick was an American novelist, short story writer, and essayist whose
    published work during his lifetime was almost entirely in the science fiction genre.
    Dick explored sociological, political and metaphysical themes in novels dominated by
    monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, and altered states. In his
    later works, Dick's thematic focus strongly reflected his personal interest in
    metaphysics and theology. He often drew upon his own life experiences and addressed
    the nature of drug abuse, paranoia and schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences
    in novels such as A Scanner Darkly and VALIS.
