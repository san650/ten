### About book identifiers

Books can have different identifiers depending on several factors so you should
have this in mind when designing a model and the search functionalities.

Most common identifiers are ISBN10, ISBN13, OCLC and LCCN but there are others,
the best strategy is to support all of them and use the ones that are available
for each book.
