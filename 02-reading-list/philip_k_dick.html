          Philip Kindred Dick was an American novelist, short story writer, and essayist whose
          published work during his lifetime was almost entirely in the science fiction genre.
          Dick explored sociological, political and metaphysical themes in novels dominated by
          monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, and altered states. In his
          later works, Dick's thematic focus strongly reflected his personal interest in
          metaphysics and theology. He often drew upon his own life experiences and addressed
          the nature of drug abuse, paranoia and schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences
          in novels such as A Scanner Darkly and VALIS.
