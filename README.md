# Ten

Learn how to build web applications by doing

## What is Ten?

The idea of this project is to build _ten_ web application templates to help
people learn how to build web applications using different JavaScript
frameworks.

We provide users with HTML, CSS and other assets files plus some pointers of how
the application should behave and some useful resources such as third party web
services to fetch/store data.
